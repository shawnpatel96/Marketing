Features

What features are required for your minimum viable product?
Strain recommender
Save recommendations

For DS
Source and analyze data to better understand the reported effects of different cannabis strains/types
Data Sources (need to be confirmed):
https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/cannabis-strains
Given this, create a model to predict which strains/types a user would enjoy based on their input (desired effects). Can use any techniques you wish.
Make the recommendations accessible to the rest of the team via a Flask API or equivalent.
For Web
User creation and login
Form to gather data from the user to submit to the DS API
User can save response from the DS API to the Web backend in the user's profile
User can view saved responses and filter them in a useful way
User can edit/delete saved responses in the user's profile.

What features may you wish to put in a future release?

Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the night researching so you can hit the ground running on Wednesday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
